# Tactical-Intervention---RMC-Branch
Backporting features and weapons from Arctic's Tactical RP to it's predecessor Tactical Intervention because we like things that DON'T SUCK!!!

Current plans:
- Backport TacRP Extras weapons. [DONE]
- Backport tac laser and light/heavy barrel attachments.
- Rebalance some atts for more gameplay variety
- Make tac attachments override default HL2 flashlight
- Make it so shotgun reloads can be instantly cancelled (like CS 1.6)
- (Potentially) Restore the knives.
- maybe add a few new weapons idk man
